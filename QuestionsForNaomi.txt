middleware/auth.test.js
    expect.assertions(2);  
    I read the Jest docs, and still don't understand ".assertions(num)"



Models/company.js
static async create() 
    Why do a "duplicateCheck"? This is an extra query. Seems inefficient.
    Why not insert info to db and handle any errors that may arise?

The Models class/static methods do not use try/catch, what is the rationale? eg models/company.js

models/job.test.js -> .get() & .update() 
    Why does "equity" return from db as a string? aka, why does NUMERIC type return with ""?
    When I "INSERT whatever INTO jobs" NUMERIC(equity) seems to accept either a string or a number.
        Should the equity type in JS be a string or number?

How could I refactor or re-write helpers/sql.js buildJobQuery() and/or buildCompanyQuery()?
AB: check answer code too.
